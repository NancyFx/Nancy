How to build Nancy
==================

*NOTE* These instructions are *only* for building with Cake - if you just want to build Nancy manually you can do so just by loading the solution into Visual Studio 2015 and pressing build :-)

Building Nancy
--------------

1. At the command prompt, navigate to the Nancy root folder (should contain build.cake)
2. To run the default build (which will compile, test and package Nancy) type the following command:
  * On Windows type:
    ./build.ps1
  * On Linux/MacOS type:
    ./build.sh

After the build has completed, there will be a new folder in the root called "build". It contains the following folders:

* binaries -> All the Nancy assembilies and their dependencies
* packages -> Zip file containing the binaries (other configurations might be added in the future)
* nuget -> NuGet packages generated from this build
