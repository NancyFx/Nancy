        <member name="P:JetBrains.dotMemoryUnit.DotMemoryUnitAttribute.CollectAllocations">
            <summary>
            Specifies whether the memory allocation data (creation stack trace and memory traffic data) must be collected or not within a certain scope. 
            To specify the scope (an assembly, a class, or a method), mark the desired assembly, class, or method with this attribute.
            Collecting memory allocation data significantly increases the profiling overhead. Use it only if you need to measure the amount of memory traffic.
            Note that <see cref="T:JetBrains.dotMemoryUnit.AssertTrafficAttribute"/> enables collecting allocations in the marked method automatically. You do not need to set
            the <see cref="P:JetBrains.dotMemoryUnit.DotMemoryUnitAttribute.CollectAllocations"/> to true in this case.
